# CYBR8420-Team5-Project

## The Software
The software chosen for this project is the Ladybird browser, located [this website](https://ladybird.org/) and [this Github repository](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird).

## Operational Environment

## Motivation

## Project Description
Ladybird is an open-source cross-platform browser forked from another open-source project, SerenityOS. SerenityOS is a from-scratch operating system project, and Ladybird inherited much of its code. This from-scratch philosophy means that Ladybird has its own JavaScript engine, cryptography libraries, and handles its own text encoding, regex parsing, rendering, etc.

The project was started by Andreas Kling and is managed by a non-profit organization dedicated to the governance of the project. The project has over a thousand contributors throughout its history, and regularly receives hundreds of pull requests from dozens of contributors per month.

The project is mostly written in C++ with some newer code written in Swift.
