# CYBR8420-Team5-Project

## The Software
The software chosen for this project is the Ladybird browser, located [this website](https://ladybird.org/) and [this Github repository](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird).

## Operational Environment

## Motivation

## Project Description
Ladybird is an open-source cross-platform browser forked from another open-source project, SerenityOS. SerenityOS is a from-scratch operating system project, and Ladybird inherited much of its code. This from-scratch philosophy means that Ladybird has its own JavaScript engine, cryptography libraries, and handles its own text encoding, regex parsing, rendering, etc.
