# Reflection
As a group we all agreed that the most useful and rewarding aspect of this assignment was the deep dive into the actual Ladybird codebase. We learned as much about the browser from this assignment as we had from all our previous work combined. Beyond the code investigation, we gained much value from learning the threat modeling software. It was remarkable to observe how  how the tool could identify significant threats simply by analyzing our Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) constructed from boxes, circles, and lines. Applying STRIDE principles to nearly every data flow helped us to consider interactions and security aspects that we previously would have dismissed as insignificant or unrelated, opening our eyes to security considerations we had not thought about before.

The application of the threat modeling findings was very revealing, regardless of the specific feature we analyzed. Working through the DFDs and identifying the threats helped us significantly improve our ability to analyze any system from a security perspective. The most valuable part of the overall process was the required research into mitigations and looking directly into the Ladybird source code to determine which components were already providing the necessary protection. This process not only gave us stronger, practical knowledge of how to approach threat mitigation, but it also improved our understanding of secure design principles.
