# Reflections
Alex - The most useful part of this assignment was the deep dive into the actual codebase. I learned as much about Ladybird from this assignment as I had from everything else to this point. Beyond that, the threat modeling software applying STRIDE to pretty much every single flow of data caused me to think about interactions that I otherwise would have written off as insignificant or unrelated. While it ended up not being applicable due to a password manager not yet being implemented, the threats in the report caused me to do a deep dive on how browsers do protect this data.

Logan - I was baffled by the Threat Modeling software, I couldn't believe that from a couple boxes, circles, and lines, it could identify threats that a use case was facing. Reading through the findings opened my eyes to the aspects of security that I would never consider otherwise. Unlike Alex's password manager use case, the download manager is implemented and I was able to identify pieces that were being implemented and others that weren't, and the discovery of this software to me was the most valuable part of the assignment.
