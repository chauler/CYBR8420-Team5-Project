# Reflections
The most useful part of this assignment was the deep dive into the actual codebase. I learned as much about Ladybird from this assignment as I had from everything else to this point. Beyond that, the threat modeling software applying STRIDE to pretty much every single flow of data caused me to think about interactions that I otherwise would have written off as insignificant or unrelated. While it ended up not being applicable due to a password manager not yet being implemented, the threats in the report caused me to do a deep dive on how browsers do protect this data.
